To-do list on Aug 9th for meeting on Aug 13 at 3 pm EST:

- Stochastic predictive model (predicting stock price and variance following the Black-Litterman/B paper)
- Make a list of features and assemble datasets (company performance, economic indicators, historical data like prices and volume, twitter-news)
- Make a list of targets and assemble datasets (returns, stock prices, volatility)
- Select a model for prediction (diffusion model)
- Select a model to identify trend and seasonality so that detrended series can be fed into the diffusion model
-
